# üìä Sales Performance Analytics Dashboard

> **"Why did revenue spike 40% in November, yet customer acquisition remained flat?"** This question sparked my deep-dive into building an interactive analytics dashboard that transforms raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence.

## üéØ The Business Challenge

E-commerce businesses generate massive volumes of transaction data daily, yet struggle to extract meaningful insights that drive strategic decisions. This dashboard addresses the critical gap between data collection and data-driven decision-making by providing:

- **Performance optimization**: Implemented aggregated tables to handle 397K+ row dataset with sub-second load times
- **Cross-filtering complexity**: Managed bidirectional relationships between customer and product dimensions without circular dependencies
- **Scalability design**: Built modular data model supporting future integration of returns, costs, and profitability metrics

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- **Predictive analytics**: ARIMA/Prophet models for revenue forecasting
- **Cohort analysis**: Customer retention and churn prediction using Python/R integration
- **Real-time streaming**: Power BI streaming datasets for live transaction monitoring
- **Profitability layer**: Cost data integration for margin analysis by product and customer segment

## üíº Why This Matters

**For Business Leaders**: This dashboard transforms reactive reporting into proactive strategy by surfacing hidden patterns in customer behavior, geographic performance, and product demand.

**For Technical Teams**: Demonstrates proficiency in modern BI tools, data modeling best practices, and the ability to translate complex datasets into intuitive, performant visualizations.

- ETL Operations:
  - Data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation of customer and product dimensions
  - Handled missing customer IDs and standardized country naming conventions
  - Removed duplicates and test records; validated integrity with revenue/transaction cross-checks

### Calculated Metrics (DAX)
- Average Order Value = Total Revenue / Total Transactions

### Advanced DAX Calculations
~~~DAX
-- Core Measures
Total Revenue =
SUM ( Sales[Revenue] )

Total Transactions =
DISTINCTCOUNT ( Sales[InvoiceNo] )

Total Customers =
DISTINCTCOUNT ( Sales[CustomerID] )

Total Quantity =
SUM ( Sales[Quantity] )

Average Order Value =
DIVIDE ( [Total Revenue], [Total Transactions], 0 )

Avg Basket Size =
DIVIDE ( [Total Quantity], [Total Transactions], 0 )

Avg Customer Lifetime Value =
DIVIDE ( [Total Revenue], [Total Customers], 0 )

-- Growth Rate (MoM %)
Growth Rate % =
VAR CurrentRevenue =
    [Total Revenue]
VAR PreviousRevenue =
    CALCULATE ( [Total Revenue], DATEADD ( 'Calendar'[Date], -1, MONTH ) )
RETURN
DIVIDE ( CurrentRevenue - PreviousRevenue, PreviousRevenue )

-- Quarter-over-Quarter Revenue Change (%)
QoQ Revenue Change % =
VAR CurrentQtr = [Total Revenue]
VAR PreviousQtr =
    CALCULATE ( [Total Revenue], PREVIOUSQUARTER ( 'Calendar'[Date] ) )
RETURN
DIVIDE ( CurrentQtr - PreviousQtr, PreviousQtr )
~~~
